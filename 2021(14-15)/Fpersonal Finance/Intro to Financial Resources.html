<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Summary</span></strong></p>
<p>Crypto Arbitrage is the concept of buying a coin at one place, and selling it at another immediately, for a small profit.<br />The way this works is that we check the price of a coin at multiple exchanges. When we see that there is a difference of price, we buy at the lower place, and sell at the higher place. there are more factors to consider like gas fees, and price changes. For this reason we use something called a complex transaction, which is where we preform all of our trades at once, allowing us to cancel it all if need be, with no repercussions.<br /><strong></strong></p>
